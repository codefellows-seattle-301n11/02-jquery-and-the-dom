## Overview
This application builds blog articles from raw string data and populates the articles on the weppage.  DOM maniplutaion is done through jQuery and articles are sorted by date.

## Getting Started
Using knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery, complete the assigned tasks.

Raw data is an array of objects.  It is passed through a constructor function to build all of the articles.  jQuery is then used to build the articles into the html, based off of a template.
